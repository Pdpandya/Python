## A list is a versatile data structure used to store a collection of items. Lists are mutable, meaning that their elements can be modified after creation. Lists can contain elements of different types, including integers, floats, strings, and even other lists.

list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
list.reverse()
print(list)
